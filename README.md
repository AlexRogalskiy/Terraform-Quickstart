- The `aws` directory contains the Terraform configuration files for deploying a MongoDB cluster on AWS.
- The `azure` directory contains the Terraform configuration files for deploying a MongoDB cluster on Azure.
- The `gcp` directory contains the Terraform configuration files for deploying a MongoDB cluster on GCP.

## Usage

To deploy a MongoDB cluster on a specific cloud provider, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the respective cloud provider directory (`aws`, `azure`, or `gcp`).
2. Update the variables in the `main.tf` file with your desired configuration, such as instance types, cluster size, network settings, etc.
3. Initialize the Terraform project:

   ```shell
   terraform init
Preview the changes that will be applied:

shell
Copy code
terraform plan
Deploy the MongoDB cluster:

shell
Copy code
terraform apply
Confirm the deployment by typing yes when prompted.

Wait for Terraform to provision the MongoDB cluster resources.

Once the deployment is complete, you will see the output variables showing the necessary connection details, such as the MongoDB connection string or endpoint.

Connect to the MongoDB cluster using the provided connection details from your application or MongoDB client.

Conclusion
This Terraform repository enables you to deploy MongoDB clusters on AWS, Azure, and GCP using infrastructure-as-code. Feel free to explore the respective directories for cloud-specific configuration files and customize them according to your requirements.

You can leverage the power and scalability of MongoDB in the cloud with ease using this Terraform repository.
